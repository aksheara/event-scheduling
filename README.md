   - Click `Advanced system settings`, then `Environment Variables`.
   - In the `System variables` section, find and select the `Path` variable, then click `Edit`.
   - Click `New` and add the path to the PHP directory (e.g., `C:\php`).
   - Click `OK` to close all dialog boxes.

4. **Verify PHP Installation**: Open a Command Prompt and type `php -v` to verify that PHP is installed correctly and added to the PATH.

### 2. Clone the Repository
